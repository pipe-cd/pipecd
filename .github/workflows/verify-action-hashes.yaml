# Ensures every GitHub Action in our workflows is pinned by commit hash (not tag).
# That improves supply chain security: we run a fixed, auditable version of each action.
# The job runs hack/gha-reversemap.sh verify-mapusage, which checks that each "uses:"
# line points to a 40-char hash listed in .gha-reversemap.yml. If the check fails,
# run "hack/gha-reversemap.sh apply-reversemap" locally and commit the changes.
