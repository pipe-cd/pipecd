# Kubernetes plugin

## Overview

Kubernetes plugin supports the Deployment for Kubernetes.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Currently, this is alpha status.

### Quick sync

Quick sync just applies all the defined manifiests to sync the application.

It will be planned in one of the following cases:
- no pipeline was specified in the application configuration file
- `pipeline` was specified but the PR did not make any changes on workload (e.g. Deployment's pod template) or config (e.g. ConfigMap, Secret)

For example, the application configuration as below is missing the pipeline field. This means any pull request touches the application will trigger a quick sync deployment.

``` yaml
apiVersion: pipecd.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
spec:
  plugins: 
    kubernetes:
      input:
        helmChart:
          name: helloworld
          path: /path/to/chart
          version: v0.3.0
```

In another case, even when the pipeline was specified, a PR that just changes the Deployment's replicas number for scaling will also trigger a quick sync deployment.

### Pipeline sync

You can configure the pipeline to enable a progressive deployment with a strategy like canary, blue-green.

To enable customization, Kubernetes plugin defines three variants for each application: primary (aka stable), baseline and canary.
- `primary` runs the current version of code and configuration.
- `baseline` runs the same version of code and configuration as the primary variant. (Creating a brand-new baseline workload ensures that the metrics produced are free of any effects caused by long-running processes.)
- `canary` runs the proposed change of code or configuration.

Depending on the configured pipeline, any variants can exist and receive the traffic during the deployment process but once the deployment is completed, only the `primary` variant should be remained.

These are the provided stages for Kubernetes plugin you can use to build your pipeline:

- `K8S_SYNC`
  - sync application to the state specified in the target Git commit without any progressive strategy
- `K8S_PRIMARY_ROLLOUT`
  - update the primary resources to the state defined in the target commit
- `K8S_CANARY_ROLLOUT`
  - generate canary resources based on the definition of the primary resource in the target commit and apply them
- `K8S_CANARY_CLEAN`
  - remove all canary resources
- `K8S_BASELINE_ROLLOUT`
  - generate baseline resources based on the definition of the primary resource in the target commit and apply them
- `K8S_BASELINE_CLEAN`
  - remove all baseline resources
