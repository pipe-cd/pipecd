### Why PipeCD?

- Simple, unified and easy to use but powerful pipeline definition to construct your deployment
- Same deployment interface to deploy applications of any platform, including Kubernetes, Terraform, GCP Cloud Run, AWS Lambda, AWS ECS
- No CRD or applications' manifest changes are required; Only need a pipeline definition along with your application manifests
- No deployment credentials are exposed or required outside the application cluster
- Built-in deployment analysis as part of the deployment pipeline to measure impact based on metrics, logs, emitted requests
- Easy to interact with any CI; The CI tests and builds artifacts, PipeCD takes the rest
- Insights show metrics like lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR and change failure rate to measure delivery performance
- Designed to manage thousands of cross-platform applications in multi-cloud for company scale but also work well for small projects
