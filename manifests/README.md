# Manifests

PipeCD uses [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to managing its manifests.

This directory contains PipeCD chart templates which be used to generate the usable manifests. \
The REAL usable PipeCD charts are published on [PipeCD Org packages](https://github.com/orgs/pipe-cd/packages?tab=packages&q=chart).
