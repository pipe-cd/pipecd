title: "Contribute to PipeCD Documentation"
---

Welcome! We are so happy you're interested in helping improve our documentation. Your contributions make the project better for everyone.

This guide explains how you can submit documentation changes.

## Where to find the docs

Our documentation is located in the `/docs` folder within the [pipe-cd/pipecd repository](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipecd).

The content files are written in Markdown and live inside `/docs/content/en/`. You'll notice two types of documentation folders:

* `/docs-dev/`: This is for documentation related to unreleased, in-development features.
* `/docs-v0.x.x/` (and `/docs-v1.0.x/`): These folders contain the documentation for specific released versions of PipeCD.

## How to build the docs locally

To preview your changes as you work, you must run the documentation website on your local machine.

1.  **Install Prerequisite:** You must have the **extended** version of [Hugo (v0.92.1 or higher)](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed.
2.  **Run the Server:** From the root of the `pipecd` repository, run the following command:
    ```bash
    make run/site
    ```
3.  **Preview:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:1313` to see the live-reloading site.

## How to submit your changes (The PR Process)

1.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b my-docs-fix`).
2.  **Make Your Changes:** Edit the necessary documentation files. If you are fixing an issue in the current documentation, remember to edit the file in both the `/docs-dev/` and the latest `/docs-v1.0.x/` folders.
3.  **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes with a clear message and push your branch to your fork.
4.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the PipeCD repository and open a Pull Request. In the description, please link to the issue you are fixing (e.g., `Addresses #6124`).
5.  **Review:** A maintainer will review your PR, provide feedback, and merge it.
