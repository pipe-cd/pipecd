In the previous section, we saw that every PipeCD application requires a configuration file (we call it the application configuration file) that contains the application's information (such as name, label, etc) and also defines how should Piped deploy that application. In this section, we will show you how to define a deployment pipeline for different application types.

>**NOTE:**
> This guide explains application configuration for applications to be deployed using PipeCD V1.
>If you are using a PipeCD V0.x.x, and want to switch to PipeCD V1, see [Migrating from V0 to V1](../../migrating-from-v0-to-v1/_index.md).
