The previous section demonstrated how to use PipeCD supporting application kind's stages to build up a pipeline that defines how Piped should deploy your application. In this section, aside from the application kind specified stages, we will see some commonly defined pipeline stages, which can be used to build up a more fashionable deployment pipeline for your application.
