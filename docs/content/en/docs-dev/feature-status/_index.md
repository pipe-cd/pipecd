Please note that the phases (Incubating, Alpha, Beta, and Stable) are applied to individual features within the project, not to the project as a whole.

## Feature Phase Definitions

| Phase | Definition |
|-|-|
| Incubating | Under planning/developing the prototype and still not ready to be used. |
| Alpha | Demo-able, works end-to-end but has limitations. No guarantees on backward compatibility. |
| Beta | **Usable in production**. Documented. |
| Stable | Production hardened. Backward compatibility. Documented. |
