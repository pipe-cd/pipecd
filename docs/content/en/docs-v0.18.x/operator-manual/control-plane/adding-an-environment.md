An environment is a logical group of applications, pipeds inside a project. A project can have multiple environments.
Each application must belong to one and only one environment. While each piped must belong to at least one environment.

The list of environments is shown in the Settings page. Anyone who has the project admin role can add a new environment by clicking on the `+ADD` button.
