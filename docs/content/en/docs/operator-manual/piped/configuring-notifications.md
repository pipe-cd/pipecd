  This page describes how to configure piped to send notifications to external services.
---

PipeCD events (deployment triggered, planned, completed, analysis result, piped started...) can be sent to external services like Slack or a Webhook service. While forwarding those events to a chat service helps developers have a quick and convenient way to know the deployment's current status, forwarding to a Webhook service may be useful for triggering other related tasks like CI jobs.

PipeCD events are emitted and sent by the `piped` component. So all the needed configurations can be specified in the `piped` configuration file.
Notification configuration including:
- a list of `Route`s which used to match events and decide where the event should be sent to
- a list of `Receiver`s which used to know how to send events to the external service

[Notification Route](/docs/operator-manual/piped/configuration-reference/#notificationroute) matches events based on their metadata like `name`, `group`, `env`, `app`.
Below is the list of supporting event names and their groups.

| Event | Group |
|-|-|
| DEPLOYMENT_TRIGGERED | DEPLOYMENT |
| DEPLOYMENT_PLANNED | DEPLOYMENT |
| DEPLOYMENT_APPROVED | DEPLOYMENT |
| DEPLOYMENT_WAIT_APPROVAL | DEPLOYMENT |
| DEPLOYMENT_ROLLING_BACK | DEPLOYMENT |
| DEPLOYMENT_SUCCEEDED | DEPLOYMENT |
| DEPLOYMENT_FAILED | DEPLOYMENT |
| DEPLOYMENT_CANCELLED | DEPLOYMENT |
| APPLICATION_SYNCED | APPLICATION_SYNC |
| APPLICATION_OUT_OF_SYNC | APPLICATION_SYNC |
| APPLICATION_HEALTHY | APPLICATION_HEALTH |
| APPLICATION_UNHEALTHY | APPLICATION_HEALTH |
| PIPED_STARTED | PIPED |
| PIPED_STOPPED | PIPED |
