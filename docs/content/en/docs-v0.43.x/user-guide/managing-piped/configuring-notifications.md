  This page describes how to configure piped to send notifications to external services.
---

PipeCD events (deployment triggered, planned, completed, analysis result, piped started...) can be sent to external services like Slack or a Webhook service. While forwarding those events to a chat service helps developers have a quick and convenient way to know the deployment's current status, forwarding to a Webhook service may be useful for triggering other related tasks like CI jobs.

PipeCD events are emitted and sent by the `piped` component. So all the needed configurations can be specified in the `piped` configuration file.
Notification configuration including:
- a list of `Route`s which used to match events and decide where the event should be sent to
- a list of `Receiver`s which used to know how to send events to the external service

[Notification Route](../configuration-reference/#notificationroute) matches events based on their metadata like `name`, `group`, `app`, `labels`.
Below is the list of supporting event names and their groups.

| Event | Group | Supported |
|-|-|-|
| DEPLOYMENT_TRIGGERED | DEPLOYMENT | <p style="text-align: center;"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled></p> |
