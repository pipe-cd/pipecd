# Summary

To simplify the creation of a configuration file using the pipectl init command.

# Motivation

Easily accept new users by making it easy to adopt pipecd when using it for the first time.  
Also, build in the ability to easily migrate from the configuration files of users using other CD tools to PipeCD.

# Detailed design

pipectl init command will be added to the pipectl command.
The pipectl init command will have 3 features.

1. Create a configuration file from scratch
2. Create a configuration file from an existing configuration file
3. Create a configuration file from an existing configuration file of another CD tool

I think it would be better to split the Release by feature.

## 1. Create a configuration file from scratch

This feature creates a configuration file by allowing the user to interactively enter information.
It is supposed to set only the minimum required setting values.
Users are expected to add complex settings themselves.
Even the minimum necessary values can be used to try out the system at hand, and the skeleton reduces the time and effort required for subsequent setups.

### Setting values

Think about the necessary settings from the above

#### Target Application

## 2. Create a configuration file from an existing configuration file

Read deployment.yaml or service.yaml for k8s, or taskdef.yaml or taskdef.yaml for ECS, and make app.pipecd.yaml.
Use a generative AI to create.

It would be better to use the OpenAI API.
If possible, it would be more accurate to support only gpt4-turbo.
But it would be better to support gpt3-turbo as well.
gpt3 is more open to unpaid users.

## 3. Create a configuration file from an existing configuration file of another CD tool

Read the configuration file of the CD tool and make app.pipecd.yaml.
Use a generative AI to create.

It would be better to use the OpenAI API.
If possible, it would be more accurate to support only gpt4-turbo.
But it would be better to support gpt3-turbo as well.

# Unresolved questions

## How to have pipeline specified
The current design assumes that if the user selects bluegreen or canary, a default pipeline will be created.  
But it may be better to set up the pipeline interactively at each step.  
In this case, it is difficult to know how to terminate the step-by-step interaction.
