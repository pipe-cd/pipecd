## Repositories
- [pipecd](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipecd): contains all source code and documentation of PipeCD project.

## Commands

- `make build/go`: builds all go modules including pipecd, piped, pipectl.
- `make test/go`: runs all unit tests of go modules.
- `make run/piped`: runs Piped locally (for more information, see [here](#how-to-run-piped-agent-locally)).
- `make gen/code`: generate Go and Typescript code from protos and mock configs. You need to run it if you modified any proto or mock definition files.

## How to run Piped agent locally

1. Prepare the piped configuration file `piped-config.yaml`

2. Ensure that your `kube-context` is connecting to the right kubernetes cluster

3. Run the following command to start running `piped` (if you want to connect Piped to a locally running Control Plane, add `INSECURE=true` option)

    ``` console
    make run/piped CONFIG_FILE=piped-config.yaml
    ```
