## How to run Control Plane locally

1. Start running a Kubernetes cluster

    ``` console
    make kind-up
    ```

    Once it is no longer used, run `make kind-down` to delete it.

2. Install Control Plane into the local cluster

    ``` console
    make run/pipecd
    ```

    Once all components are running up, use `kubectl port-forward` to expose the installed Control Plane on your localhost:

    ``` console
    kubectl -n pipecd port-forward svc/pipecd 8080
    ```

3. Access to the local Control Plane web console

    Point your web browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to login with the configured static admin account: project = `quickstart`, username = `hello-pipecd`, password = `hello-pipecd`.
